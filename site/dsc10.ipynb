    "Have you ever been to one of those DH talks that involved dazzling graphs, showing some aspect of literature at a scale way bigger than you can imagine, and thought to yourself, “Wow… I wonder *how they did that*?” These slides usually whiz by at a brisk clip, appearing just long enough for you to marvel at the nicely-clustered bunches of colorful dots with a brief explanation from the speaker, before moving on to the next thing. I don’t think there’s some kind of conspiracy afoot here -- like most DH work, there’s just *so much* you want to share, especially with a DH-friendly audience, and only so much you can pack into 20 or even 40 minutes. But one side effect of the quick pace of these talks is that they rarely stay on one colorful visualization long enough for the sense of unease to sink in. There are some visualizations that the audience knows how to read. Comparing the number of occurrences for different character names? Yup, no problem, that’s the stuff of first grade math.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Typicality ; project overview\n",
    "```\n",
    "This was a slide from a talk that Associate Data-Sitter Mark Algee-Hewitt gave at *DARIAH Beyond Europe*, a conference at Stanford a few weeks before I started working there in fall 2018. He was speaking about a project in the Stanford Literary Lab called “Typicality”, or “Typicality as Mean”. This chart shows American fiction-- specifically, the Gale American Fiction corpus. My fellow Data-Sitter Roopsi critiqued that corpus in our recent LitLab talk, on account of all the American fiction that gets left out -- significantly, non-English fiction and fiction by people who were not white men with access to mainstream commercial publishing channels. Anyhow, with those caveats in place, it takes this corpus of (a subset of) American fiction and looks for the “most average” one -- the one that is closest to the middle. Not one off in the romance cluster, not one over by the mysteries. Just… totally average for this corpus, or as close to it as you can get.\n",
    "\n",
    "That book, by the way, is “The Dragon’s Daughter” by Clyde C. Westover. In his talk, Mark noted that he’s probably one of the only people to have read it all the way through in the last 50 years -- which immediately prompted me to download it from Project Gutenberg and attempt the slog myself. But boy, is it ever a slog. A hackneyed plot, liberally sprinkled with jaw-dropping racism, applied to everyone from an Irish policeman to the protagonists who are implicated in the Chinese mafia of San Francisco. I gave up halfway through, so I guess Mark can legitimately keep saying he’s the only one who’s read it. (In Russian there’s a handy set of verbal prefixes you can use to differentiate “read some of” and “read all the way to the end”. I miss having those in English.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But even as I’ve tried to put “The Dragon’s Daughter” out of my mind, I haven’t forgotten about that visualization. I wanted to understand what he did to make it -- and even more importantly, I wanted to *actually* understand how to read it, beyond smiling and nodding along with the explanation. \n",

    "```\n",
    "One of the cool things about the Data-Sitters Club being part of the LitLab is that it makes it easy to build on work that’s been done for other projects. (And all the other Lab members have been super nice about answering my questions and helping me wrangle their code.) The Typicality code is Mark’s, and Mark primarily works in R. I don’t know how to explain this to a monolingual English speaker, but dealing with R code when you’re … let’s call it an “intermediate” Python user is kind of like trying to read Italian with high-school Spanish. (Or, if I’m having a bad day, like trying to read *Romanian* with high-school Spanish.) Most of the high-level structure of the language is comparable, and a lot of the roots are recognizable, but I wouldn’t claim it’s something I’m exactly comfortable doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, it would make sense to show you the Typicality code next, then talk about how to interpret it. On the other hand, the Typicality code is going to make a lot more sense after we talk, conceptually, about what it’s doing. (Trust me on this, as someone who ran the Typicality code blindly for a while before understanding it.) So for the moment, let’s just say I ran some code and visualized the output and it looked something like Mark’s all-the-dots viz, but with the Baby-Sitters Club books. All we needed was someone to help interpret it. And I knew just the person."

    "Heather Froehlich (Penn State University) has wavy-curly red hair and a more-than-passing similarity in style to the famed missing Waldo. She has an affinity for stripes, and like the Baby-Sitters Club members spent her tween years in New England. She spends a lot of time pondering computers and how they understand language. She spends even more time thinking about what people’s brains can do with the resulting data, because as she will be the first to tell you, “computers are dumb boxes of plastic and metal”. In her position as Literary Informatics Librarian at Penn State University, she has the opportunity to consult with a range of scholars in diffuse fields about all the ways people can work smartly with the data computers give us and how to get them to give it to us. She loves a good corpus. \n",

    "Heather is the author of such DH hits as \"[Moby Dick is About Whales, or Why Should We Count Words?](https://hfroehli.ch/2019/09/27/moby-dick-is-about-whales-or-why-should-we-count-words/)\", as well as the Programming Historian tutorial on [Corpus Analysis with AntConc](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/corpus-analysis-with-antconc), which Anouk referenced in [DSC #4: AntConc Saves the Day](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc4.html).

    "It was March 2021 when we spoke with Heather. We were both in the busy part of the term, and overwhelmed with Zooms, but it was enjoyable to spend a couple of hours with Heather and her spreadsheets. And oh were there spreadsheets! But more on that in a bit.  \n",

Quinn and Heather knew each other, but Heather and I didn't, so introductions were needed!\n",

    "“Okay, so my name is Katia and I’m an Associate Professor of Slavic Studies at the University of British Columbia, and I work on 19th-century Russian lit. My research expertise is in genre and narrative theory.” I explained. “Also, I am fascinated by the Baby-Sitters Club books, which was true when I was eight and apparently it's still true, and I’ve read a lot of them. I’m relatively new to DH, and so I usually have a lot of questions about how we do things.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Not unlike Stacey McGill, Heather really does love math and, in the absence of a whiteboard and shared space, she sent us searching for our own pen and paper so we could draw some graphs of our own. Old school style.\n",

Then, we’ll cover what PCA is and how it works, what we’re thinking when we talk about PCA which might be a better version of the same idea as graphs. Then we'll dive into a couple of these examples as a way to kind of get thinking about the relationship between different texts.”\n",

    "\n",
    "“So usually, when we talk about graphs, one of the first blockers is that often all we see is where the X-axis and the Y-axis intersect on a graph. But if we keep drawing these lines, when the Y-axis goes further down, that shows that there's a negative element to this graph. The ones on the bottom are all negative, the ones on the top are all positive, and this little dot right here in the middle is zero, where the two lines cross.”\n",

    "“It’s more rare, but you might find that you have negative things on the X-axis too, on the left, though most graphs you encounter in the world tend to be on the positive side of things. Thinking about this as a larger whole requires thinking about the relationship between each of these boxes with the other boxes,” explained Heather. “We're going to be talking about this as a *whole space*, as opposed to just the one space with only positive numbers that we're most used to seeing on graphs.”\n",

Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a way of taking lots of data and condensing it into something that is more human readable.”"

You might be wondering, “Why are we ignoring the elephant in the room and not using something like ‘species’ or ‘color’?” (Thankfully, the Mancusi menagerie does not include an actual elephant.) PCA works with *continuous* data, and it’s not intended for data that codes categories with 1’s and 0’s (e.g. if there were a “dog” column), or other arbitrary marks intended to designate categories (e.g. if there were a “species” column where 1 = “dog”, 2 = “cat”, etc.)[^1]\n",

    "Jessi might try a bar graph on the pets’ weight to get a sense of what she’s dealing with, and if she has weight + length, she might try a line graph. But once we start throwing in teeth and legs and hairs and average decibels, it’s more than Jessi can possibly keep in her head, and the usual graphing software wouldn’t be much happier about it than she is. That said, there is some relationship between all those different traits: longer animals tend to have more hairs (unless they don’t have any). Heavier animals tend to be louder (except for the annoying parakeet). If Jessi were to take the spreadsheet and use PCA on it, odds are that the pets of the same species would cluster together in the resulting chart -- but **not** because PCA somehow “guessed” the species. PCA takes all the data and creates **new** parameters -- called principal components -- that by themselves are uninterpretable numbers, but in their relationship to one another, they capture something meaningful about the relationships between points of the original data.\n",

    "Heather blinked. “Yeah, if you did this with 225, you'd have numbers down to the floor. And that's, again, too much to keep in your head. So let’s go back to this simpler table. So instead of plotting each of these things on a graph, what we want to do is *draw the line that covers the most amount of variation that covers this axis*.”\n",
    "\n",
    "She gestured towards the grid she had drawn earlier. “I know my hand is making this hard on Zoom. We want to use the X-axis to capture the most variation in the data. So we’re going to look at all the data in the table and condense it into something that is more human-friendly. What value for each book captures the most amount of variation across those books? 250 books x 4 dimensions -- red, yellow, brown, black -- isn’t so big for me to do in my head, but we want the end result to be set into two dimensions so we can graph it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“With this Typicality code, there are like 1,000 dimensions because each of the overall most common nouns has a word-count for each book. How do you squish that into two dimensions?” asked Quinn.\n",
    "\n",
    "“So, crucially, we don’t work well in 1,000 dimensions, right? We struggle after, like, three dimensions most of the time. Even encountering four dimensions in college, it’s like, ‘I don’t know how to do this’. We as humans like to see things visually in two dimensions -- sometimes we can handle three, but we do really well in two dimensions. So that’s what PCA’s trying to do,” explained Heather. “But to get there, we have to flatten the variation in our data a whole bunch. And this comes into play when you’re trying to interpret it.”"

But some of the other series cluster more clearly. What do you see with the distribution of the colors? Let’s start with orange -- and use your quadrant names, please.”\n",

So something that happens in quadrant 1 cannot be pulled by something happening in quadrant 3. What happens above the X-axis is typically lacking something that's below it, or vice versa. And the other thing I want you to think about is not just on the X- and Y-axes, but also on the quadrant. So something that happens in quadrant one is unlikely to also be happening in quadrant three because those things are pulling in opposite directions,” explained Heather.\n",

But once you let in words that relate to the author signal, suddenly Nancy Drew separates out, and there's overlap between the Hardy Boys and Boxcar Children.

Here we’re looking at Sweet Valley High, the original series, and that one really is more like Gossip Girl and California Diaries. The girls in SVH and CD are older, they’re sometimes dealing with the same kind of edgier issues (like drug addiction, sex, etc.).

    "#### What Typicality Does\n",
    "The Typicality code takes the most frequent nouns across all the texts, and then uses the frequencies of those nouns in each text to plot a location for that text in multi-dimensional space -- meaning that if you go with the default of 1,000 nouns, you get coordinates for the text in 1,000-dimensional space. We've talked a little bit about [grappling with mega-dimensional space before in DSC #8](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc8.html#what-do-we-compare-when-we-compare-texts) in the context of *vectorizing texts*, and that's what we're doing here, too: turning each text into a *vector* consisting of 1,000 coordinates based on the frequency of each of the top 1,000 nouns. But in DSC #8, we were measuring the distance between the vectors as one way of looking at text similarity. Here, we're using PCA to generate principal component values for each of the texts, and then we'll plot the first two principal components (which account for the greatest variation in the data) as the X- and Y-values in an easier-to-understand 2-dimensional space. You could make other choices about how to visualize the data, like graphing PC1 vs PC2 vs PC3 in 3-dimensional space (in case you want a graph that looks even more baffling to people who aren't used to interpreting PCA visualizations)! There's no single \"right\" next step once you have your PC values, though -- it's an interpretive decision, and PC1 on the X-axis and PC2 on the Y-axis is just something that people often go with. The interpretive spin on all this that Mark's Typicality  approach offers is that the concept that the most \"typical\" text is the one that's closest to (0,0) or the *center* of the grid: not too far up, not too far down. Not too far left, not too far right. Just... average."

But you're not done yet! From RStudio, you need to install the [IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) package, and then open up a command line, type `R` and press enter to get to somewhere you can run R commands, then type  `IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)` and press enter which will let your Jupyter notebook environment know that an R kernel (a kernel lets you run code in a particular language) exists. Once you've done that, you should be able to create new Jupyter notebooks using the R kernel, which can make use of any of the packages that you've installed using R Studio.\n",

But in practice, it’s not worth it to do the math for all 250 because there are diminishing returns. You can calculate the percentage of the variation that each principal component covers. PC1 always covers the most variation -- it depends on your data, but 25% is a plausible number for what PC1 might cover. And it all goes downhill from there, so by the time you get to PCA 200, it’s not explaining a whole lot. Plus, keep in mind that we’re trying to flatten everything down to 2 dimensions using values that summarize the biggest range of variation.

    "The mention of \"most frequent words\" lit off sparks in my brain: the top-1,000-word PCA model for the series books! Maybe that's why the series were so strongly delineated! I mean, yes, there were ghostwriters involved for most or all of the series, but if they were trying to write in a consistent voice and style, maybe that attenuated some of the \"author signal\" from the ghostwriters. What would happen if we color-coded the BSC chart with the top-1,000 words by ghostwriter? And were there any ghostwriters who wrote for more than one of the series we had in our corpora?!

If you're interested in dialogue, that has a lot to do with verb tenses, and you can try part-of-speech. We used part-of-speech in the Lab's Microgenres project because we were interested in grammatical similarities across texts rather than semantics. The Lab's Personhood project, on the other hand, used syntactical features -- we were less into looking at words, and more into the relationships between words. Who or what is 'owned', vs. 'put', vs. 'does'?\"\n",

    "I nodded. I really liked what the Lab had done with Microgenres, looking at moments in novels that shifted into a kind of narration style more reminiscent of a different genre of writing. My kingdom for a corpus of real teenage girl diaries or letters to use as something to compare grammatically against the Baby-Sitters Club, especially the parts where they're writing letters or in the BSC club notebook! Maybe my fellow Data-Sitters would be willing to digitize theirs... or maybe we could try this approach to see if detective fiction (like Nancy Drew) has a narration style that crops up here and there in the BSC Mysteries? I'd been thinking about Personhood too, especially whether there were syntactic features that clearly distinguished between children and the teenage protagonists, or teenage protagonists vs. adults.\n",

    "But Mark wasn't finished. \"There are lots of different possible feature sets, and choosing one is a statement about what you care about. Noun-ness of a corpus -- its 'object world' -- is a better representation of a certain kind of about-ness than verbs, adjectives, or more frequent verbs. The choice of nouns was a hypothesis of the Typicality project, baked into the feature set we chose. You can do that with part-of-speech, or you can look at ranges within the overall word frequency. It's really well established at this point that the highest-frequency words are useful for author signal, but that's not the only range that gives us something valuable. The 150-300th most common words are another range that can get at the 'about-ness' of the text,\" he said.\n",

When we pick a proxy and it ‘doesn’t work’ for what we expect it to show us, sometimes it’s not something to ‘fix.’ Maybe it’s a moment for us to re-evaluate what we think we know about authorship, themes, characters, or whatever else we’re trying to pin down computationally.”\n",

    "As he put it in a forthcoming chapter, “Computing Criticism: Humanities Concepts and Digital Methods” in *Debates in Digital Humanities: Computation*:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Not only does this approach give us new purchase on the ways in which computational text analysis can be of use in the humanities, it also restores a crucial potential of the Digital Humanities. By being guided by the methods that we adopt, by paying attention to how we approximate textual phenomena through quantification and by taking the results of our clusters and models as reflexively interpretable objects themselves (rather than simply as proxies for the true objects that we seek to study), we can use the methods and strategies of the Digital Humanities to put pressure on our received theoretical and historical objects to and uncover alternative ways of thinking about the material that we study.”\n",

    "“Right,” I said, “So, I understand what we’re doing, but what I don’t get is why some of these books in particular are towards the edge. Some of them seem like they should be closer to the mean. Let’s see what is closest to  the middle to see what the more ‘typical’ books are. What would be the most average BSC book?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I checked with Roopsi about this,” said Quinn, referring to Roopika Risam, the Data-Sitter with the most encyclopedic knowledge of the series. “She argued that there is no such thing as a ‘typical’ BSC book because ‘they all are somewhere on the spectrum of afterschool special or Something Happens’. She broke the books down into the categories of ‘Family drama’, ‘Someone leaves/returns’, ‘Mysteries (in the regular series)’, ‘Boy trouble’, and ‘Very Special Episode (anorexia, racism, domestic abuse)’. But she also acknowledged a few with ‘banal plots’ like *BSC #22: Jessi Ramsey, Pet-Sitter*, and *BSC #21: Mallory and the Trouble with Twins*.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“What do you think it is?” Quinn asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Maybe the ones with banal plots are ‘average’? I’ve got one for that list: *BSC #45: Kristy and the Baby Parade*.” I said. “An average BSC book for me would have a plot that focuses on the baby-sitting, would be set in Connecticut, and would have a lot of typical club meetings.”\n",

    "\n",
    "“Those banal books are all fairly close together in quadrant 4,” observed Quinn. “But none are all that close to the mean. Honestly, I think Roopsi might be on to something -- there’s not actually a lot of stuff clustered around the mean. Let me write some code to pull out the ten books that are actually closest to the mean.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Ooh, I get to watch you write some code? Fun!” I said.\n",

I’m reading in chronological order and this book is just so boring. I can’t do it. Books that are more boring seem to me to be more typical, or average, for the series.

    "That made sense! We’d interpreted that as the “sports” quadrant, and other leading terms in that quadrant (Q2) included “ball”, “game”, “field”, and “practice”.

Basically, it shows you how far away the frequency is from the corpus norm. It's less of a big deal when you're looking at only nouns, but especially if you're looking at the top terms overall, this will dampen down the function words that occur everywhere, and bring out the effect of words that are occurring an unusual amount in specific texts. It's used a lot when [doing stylometry](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/introduction-to-stylometry-with-python).\"\n",

    "What was Happy Holidays, Jessi doing there so centrally? Quinn was right. It had seemed like we had all the answers and biplots had solved the mystery of the PCA, but this book’s placement seemed odd. After all, a holiday special book didn’t seem like it should be typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought about Happy Holidays, Jessi, a book I hadn’t yet gotten to on my analog reread, but which I remembered from my original read in the 90s. A quick search for a plot summary confirmed what I remembered: the book has “Happy Holidays” in the title and Jessi and her family do celebrate Christmas and Kwanzaa in it, but most of the plot is about her younger brother’s injury in a car accident. The plot centers on family, the hospital, and childcare. \n",
    "\n",
    "I texted all this to Quinn and added, “What if we tested it with something else to see what the words in the book are doing?”\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Voyant ; use as interpretive tool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I put the corpus file for BSC #103 into [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), and with even the first visualization, Cirrus the word cloud, I could see what was happening. I expanded the word count as high as it would go, to 500:\n",
    "<img src='_static/images/dsc10_cirrus-103.png' alt='Wordcloud of Happy Holidays Jessi from Voyant' />\n",
    "\n",
    "I sent the cloud to Quinn and texted, “Look! The words are mostly just average, typical words! Kwanzaa is there and some names, but otherwise it’s all family words, home, kitchen, room, etc. What you’d expect for a series about teenage girls babysitting, I guess.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Oooh,” texted Quinn. “This is good! This is good! But one catch is that we’re only doing nouns. Do you want me to share the nouns only corpus with you?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes, please!”\n",
    "\n",
    "I restarted Voyant and uploaded the nouns-only file of *Happy Holidays, Jessi*... And we got joy!\n",
    "<img src='_static/images/dsc10_cirrus-103nouns.png' alt='Nouns-only wordcloud of Happy Holidays Jessi from Voyant' />\n",
    "\n",
    "“Look!” I texted Quinn, “Look at this!” I sent the word cloud of the top 500 nouns. “This is completely what I would expect in a typical book! Kwanzaa and the names were proper nouns, not regular nouns, so they weren’t even part of the nouns-only files we analyzed for the PCA! What’s left is just…. everyday life for the Baby-Sitters Club.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now that’s an ending,” Quinn replied. “And isn’t it cool that we’re starting to have a suite of tools at our disposal to investigate things with?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The interesting thing I realized through doing this is that when I think about a Baby-Sitters Club book’s plot, I think about the things that happen. But a plot isn’t just nouns. Or adjectives. Or even words. It’s the combination of those things. You can have a bunch of mentions of “beach” in a beach novel, but it doesn’t make all beach novels seem all that similar to the reader. As a reader, you think about similarity and typicality as two sides of the same coin. But the computer hasn’t read any of the Baby-Sitters Club books in the same sense that you have. The computer only counts nouns, or words, or whatever you give it. BSC #103: *Happy Holidays, Jessi* doesn’t seem like it should be typical, but when you look at what the computer is processing, all the nouns that make it more of a stand-out are stripped away. The results can be counterintuitive on a corpus like ours, a small one where there isn’t necessarily a lot of diversity of vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{index} single: Collaboration ; domain expertise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An important take-away from DSC #10 is that you need to know your corpus and also know what you’re looking for before you try to draw conclusions! Some might say we’re way too familiar with the specifics of the books’ plots, but one of the key areas of expertise that Roopsi and I bring to the DSC is our knowledge of the BSC corpus. For PCA, this is crucial. Over the course of this book, I’ve had so many texts from Quinn asking me about why this book appears there, or what the specifics are with that book, in order to figure out what it is doing. PCA is counting words, extracting data, and creating visualizations, but in order to interpret the results you get, you need to know both what the computer is reading and what is in your corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the YAMS corpus, PCA can show us that the Baby-Sitters Mystery series is more similar to the regular BSC books than other YA mysteries. And it can show us that Gossip Girl and Sweet Valley High are similar to one another. And that there’s a more complicated relationship between the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and Boxcar Children that gives you different results depending on whether you’re looking at nouns or all words. But it isn’t going into the specifics in a thorough way. It is counting nouns or words or whatever and munging parts of it together in a graph so that we can understand what’s happening better than we could on a SPREADSHEET OF DOOM. That can be really useful, but it’s important to remember that, as with any of these tools, it can’t tell you everything. "
