        <h1 id="dsc-3---the-truth-about-digital-humanities-collaboration-and-textual-variants">DSC #3 - <em>The Truth About Digital Humanities Collaboration (and Textual Variants!)</em></h1>

<p>by Maria Sachiko Cecire, January 10, 2020</p>

<p>I read the email thread again. Then one more time. “Oh my gosh,” I whispered. “What do I say?”</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasittersclub/site/master/truth-about-stacey-rerelease.jpg" alt="First rerelease cover of The Truth About Stacey" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;" /> The first message in the thread, titled “Amazing discovery for our next volume!” was from Quinn, who’d had the <a href="/site/dsc1/">great idea</a> to start the Data-Sitters Club in the first place. The DSC is a group of scholars that are creating a DH guide to computational text analysis by building and analyzing a corpus of the Baby-Sitters Club books, and I was the last member to join before we launched a few months ago (there’s more about all the members of the gang and our history in <a href="/site/chapter-2/">Chapter 2</a>). Quinn asked me to be part of the DSC because of my background in <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/re-enchanted">children’s literature and childhood studies</a>, and because of my DH-friendliness as the director of the <a href="https://eh.bard.edu">Center for Experimental Humanities</a> at Bard College. But not particularly for my data mining experience, because it’s not something I usually do! Everyone in the DSC was so nice, and I already knew some of the other members from before, but already I was feeling out of place.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasittersclub/site/master/truth-about-stacey-2010-reissue.jpg" alt="Cover of the 2010 rerelease of The Truth About Stacey" style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;" /> The emails I was reading were about some findings that Quinn had made when comparing the Baby-Sitters Club books she found online, with the more recently released versions we digitized through scanning and optical character recognition (OCR). These findings showed that the supposedly same books often had a lot of differences. Katia, another DSC member, helped build these two collections of Baby-Sitters Club books, and you can read about the process of corpus-building and some of the discrepancies in <a href="/site/dsc2/"><em>Katia and the Phantom Corpus</em></a>. Now everyone in the email thread was gushing about how interesting it was to see content changes that seemed to reflect updated expectations, norms, and day-to-day realities: for example, swapping twenty-first century technologies and fashions for the 80s and 90s ones in the original books. Think “styled” hair instead of “permed” hair, “player” instead of “VCR,” and amounts of money removed or updated to account for inflation. (Granted, the lack of metadata for the versions Quinn found online mean we can’t know conclusively that they’re the originals, or even older than the more recent versions we digitized, but it sure looked that way.) I was happy to see the team so enthusiastic and united, but the problem was…the findings weren’t surprising to me at all.</p>

<p>Children’s publishing has a long history of revising texts to keep up with changing social norms, especially since books for kids have always been seen as instructional (even didactic and, some claim, “civilizing”), as well as entertaining. And since children’s books are overwhelmingly written, published, and bought by adults – most of whom care a LOT about what kids are reading and thinking about – there have always been adult eyeballs on children’s literature and calls to take out or change “inappropriate” material. One old-school version of this is the <a href="https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2015/marchapril/feature/how-the-grimm-brothers-saved-the-fairy-tale">differences</a> between the first edition of the Brothers Grimm’s Children’s and Household Tales in 1812 and the “definitive” version in 1857, where the stories were dramatically edited to make them more “suitable” (less violent, sexual, and pagan) for children. They did this even though the original project was supposed to be a folk record of deep-rooted national tales, not necessarily an influence on modern youth! But from the late eighteenth century on, if you say any cultural object is “for children,” it automatically sets off all kinds of appropriateness radars.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasittersclub/site/master/oompaloompa1.jpg" alt="Original illustrations of Oompa Loompas from Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" style="float: left;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 0px;" /> Another children’s lit classic that has gotten this treatment is Roald Dahl’s <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>; there were some (honestly, reaaaally necessary) <a href="https://groovyhistory.com/oompa-loompas-the-original-ones">revisions</a> in the 1970s to deal with the fact that the Oompa Loompas were described in the ‘60s original as “amiable black pygmies” from “the very deepest and darkest part of the African jungle where no white man had been before.” Ew. (More on these kind of changes at children’s literature scholar <a href="www.philnel.com/2010/09/19/censoring-ideology/">Phil Nel’s blog</a>, from which the Oompa Loompa illustrations were taken.)</p>

<p>But the changes Quinn was seeing didn’t seem to be at the level of social lessons (unless you mean the lesson that the perm craze is better off left in the past) – they were more about making the books, as the kids say, “relatable” to modern readers. That felt pretty normal given what I knew about children’s literature too. Books for young people have been commercial products basically since they became A Thing in the mid- to late eighteenth century. Ever heard of the prestigious Newbury Medal for children’s literature? John Newbury, the “Father of Children’s Literature” was the English publisher and merchant who got the whole shebang started…by printing and selling books. Children’s presses are always looking for ways to make the same books more exciting for new markets – this results in things like the Americanizations when Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was first sold as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in the US (they stopped doing this after Book 1 though, because everyone knows a Weasley jumper is way cozier than a Weasley sweater). Children’s publishing also relies a lot more on nostalgia sales than adult books do, since all those grown-up buyers of children’s literature often want to pass down their old faves to the next generation. So it’s not uncommon for presses to re-release classics with hipper cover art and contemporary updates to the text itself. This happened with bestselling British author Enid Blyton’s books in 2010 and (a later google search revealed)…the Baby-Sitters Club books in the same year.* And most of the changes the team was discussing were the kinds of ones the BSC publisher, Scholastic, had openly announced they planned to make!</p>
