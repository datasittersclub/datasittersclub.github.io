    "It was a few days after Christmas. Omicron was sending the daily case-rate vertical, making us nostalgic for the days of [DSC Multilingual Mystery 2](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dscm2.html), when we worked through how to scrape websites, and [our example of Wikipedia noted only 777,000 confirmed cases of COVID](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dscm3.html#scraping-all-the-things) to date. At the current rate of over 480,000 reported cases per day in the United States, we'd reach that number anew by tomorrow. Lee and I were facing virtual instruction immediately after the new year, and whether you have teenagers or small kids, the holidays have a way of being exhausting.\n",

    "\n",
    "We had some ideas -- a specialist in the Quebecois translation of the Baby-Sitters Club had reached out to Lee, but in the wake of everything in 2021, we hadn't followed up. But it was better for a future book: there was no way we could schedule, conduct, and write-up an interview in the handful of days before January 2022 hit. I thought about the code I'd written for other projects in 2021, and there was one bit I was rather proud of: something that used the spaCy NLP dependency parse to identify subjects and verbs. (If \"dependency parse\" doesn't ring a bell, think the sentence diagramming you might've done in school -- breaking down a sentence into nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc. and indicating the relationships between them: subjects, objects, and the like.) \n",

    "```{index} single: Star Wars ; character verbs example\n",

    "Long story short: we can use this method to do things like identify which verbs are distinctive for particular characters -- which verbs occur far more often with a given character than all the other characters. Here's what this looked like for a project on *Star Wars* novels I did with Matt Warner, Nichole Nomura, and Associate Data-Sitter Mark Algee-Hewitt:\n",

    "```{index} single: Coreference resolution ; BookNLP\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're working with computational methods at a scale larger than what you'd be comfortable doing manually, you may feel the ping of doubt in the back of your mind. How do you know that it's catching everything? Or even most things? Or at least enough things? \"Enough\" matters with code like this, where you can only easily look at character names. There are other tools that do what's called coreference resolution: taking the pronouns (e.g. \"I\", \"she\") and linking them with the characters they refer to. That's really important: character names get used a lot less frequently than pronouns. But it turns out that's also really hard to do well. There's a tool called [BookNLP](https://github.com/dbamman/book-nlp) that David Bamman developed that does a relatively great job at it (even more so in its recent, still-under-development version), and he's working on versions for other languages as well. Until coreference resolution is part of the workflow, though, working with only character names means you're limited to a much smaller data set than you'd ideally like to have. So you want what little data you have -- sentences where a character name is the subject -- to at least mostly get picked up correctly. You can (and should!) hand-check a sample of the results: are you getting what you expect? But we had another route, because we were working with multiple French translations: we could compare how many subject/verb pairs were found in each translation, along with how many were in the original English.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't much of a research question, but as Lee and I exchanged texts that December night, we settled on, \"What's the deal with subject/verb pairs in the French translations? Anything interesting there?\""

Thankfully, its named-entity recognition for French has improved since we wrote that book in February 2020!

The output is a TSV (tab-separated value; like the more common CSV for tabular data, but less likely to be tripped up by a stray comma in your text) file with the filenames, subjects, and verbs for each file in the directory."

    "You know it’s bad news when you’re looking at three translations of six books (our French data), and the output file is about the same size as the original text of those same books (our English data). (Want to see the output files? Check out [our GitHub repo for this book](https://github.com/datasittersclub/dscm5).) File size can be an early indicator of things having gone off the rails. When you’re looking at plain text files, the file size is directly connected to the amount of text in the file – unlike Word docs, where you can have two files that are the same size, but one might have a hundred pages of text and the other might have a large image. Without even looking at the contents of the text files, if they’re the same size, they have roughly the same amount of text (and punctuation, and spaces, etc.). What’s more, these two text files were produced by the same code, using similar text files (a set of novels and their translations). Sure, French verbs and pronouns are different lengths than their English equivalents (e.g. je/j’ vs. I), but we’re not stressing the details, we’re looking for scale. If the input for our English file was one copy of each novel, and the input for our French file was three copies of each novel (Belgian, Quebecois, and modern French), we’d expect the French file to be roughly 3x the size of the English file if the French spaCy model and the English spaCy model were equally effective at pulling out subject/verb pairs.  😬 So… what happened with ⅔ of those subject-verb pairs that should be there?"

    "When I was working at Morehead State, I was asked to cover for a sabbatical and teach an intro level French course. I had grown up learning French in Quebec, and while I knew that the French (from France) looked down their noses at the Québéois accent, it didn't occur to me that the French itself was that much different save for some localized colloquialisms. Given how much the grammar was driven into our heads while we were learning the language, I figured, well, we’re learning French with a different accent, nothing more, nothing less. We all used the same dictionaries (Petit Robert, Bescherelle) after all. \n",
    "\n",
    "LOL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, the French-language textbook I was assigned to use was (of course) from France, and the differences were SHOCKING. Not only were there SO MANY words and phrases that I just didn’t know/had never used, the students struggled with the “écoute” (listening) parts because it was all French from France. More shockingly (or, really, not all that shocking) the book paid dismissive lip service to the French spoken in the wider *francophonie*, never even mentioning Quebec, nor any of the very distinct French dialects, such as Haitian Creole. \n",
    "\n",
    "And I should have known better, as well, because of an earlier experience in university. U de Sherbrooke often attracted students from across the French diaspora, including our Acadian cousins from New Brunswick (the only officially bilingual province in Canada). One day, we were hanging out with one of them, one Anglophone and one Francophone and one Acadian. Neither the Francophone nor myself could understand a single thing the Acadian was saying once he got going. \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s fascinating about Quinn’s findings are that Quebec has long asserted that Quebec French is a…*purer* form of French than what is now spoken in France, given the French’s relatively lax attitude towards expanding the language to absorb *les anglicisms* (which is a dirty word in Quebec). I’m not familiar enough with the French dialect from Belgium (for example, how much Flemish influence is there, or not?), but it could be that the influence of English (and other languages) on French (from France) and Quebec’s resistance to those same influences is part of the reason behind these discrepancies. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for names…what **is** a French name? This is actually a more complicated question, given France and Quebec’s various attitudes towards immigration, assimilation, nationalism, and even secularism. Most Gen-X Québécois were still being named after saints, and given that I went to an Anglo Catholic high school, most of my English friends had names that could be traced back to saints as well. That the model tripped up on names was really interesting to me, seeing as how I would have thought that the French (from France) model would be *more* inclusive of names from a variety of backgrounds that Quebec or Belgium, but it appears not to be the case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that Quebec cares deeply about the French language and that there is a robust Francophone DH community in Montreal especially, I would think that there would be a Québécois language data set. This is another place where I particularly miss Stéfan Sinclair - his first large DH-ish project was an online French grammar checker, back when these tools were rudimentary at best, absolutely worthless at worst. I found the tool when I was teaching that French course in Appalachia, hoping to provide some more help to the students. The tool itself “learned” from common mistakes to give suggestions and flag errors that might otherwise be missed. Surely he would know of a local data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is stating the obvious but French is not the same depending on where it is being spoken. This would be true of any language spoken in multiple different countries/contexts (this is where I wish there were multiple Spanish translations of the series as a point of comparison). Our data-sets and language models can and do recreate colonial and racialized biases in terms of what we populate them with when we make decisions on what is “French” (Or Spanish. Or Portuguese. Or…English.). The machine can only tell us so much about translations. \n",

    "```{index} single: French ; translation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of my dissertation was about the question of localized translation (as well as framing and reception). Temporality matters, context matters, audience matters. That you can have one poem that has been translated at least nine times in nine different ways is a reflection of that reality. This is why machine translation is a huge challenge. When I worked as an undergrad for the formerly giant telecommunications company Nortel as a technical writer and editor, part of my job was to flag documentation that was using non-Nortel standardized English phrases (there was a depressingly thin Nortel Standard English dictionary) with the goal of eventually being able to machine translate the documentation perfectly. If there was pushback from the writers, we had to submit the phrase for approval to be added to the dictionary, or they would come back with an approved phrase to use instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poetry, technical manuals, YA series. It doesn’t matter because context will always matter when it comes to translation - dialect, register, colloquialisms, etc. What was a common French name might not be in 20 or 30 years. Translators are constantly updating their own language use, making these difficult decisions in each situation when they are translating, processing the changes happening around them. Models are but a snapshot of a language, even with a large sample size. The model’s ability to change and adapt is nothing compared to what translators can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like many of our books, what we sought to learn wasn’t what we ended up learning, and really, this just reinforces what we already know, but maybe needed to be reminded of when it comes to distant reading; there are still some complex tasks that humans can do better and more efficiently than machines. Translation is one of them. "
