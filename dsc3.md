# DSC #3 - _The Truth About Digital Humanities Collaboration (and Textual Variants!)_

by Maria Sachiko Cecire, January 10, 2020

I read the email thread again. Then one more time. “Oh my gosh,” I whispered. “What do I say?”

![First rerelease cover of The Truth About Stacey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasittersclub/site/master/truth-about-stacey-rerelease.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-right: 5px;margin-top: 0px;"} The first message in the thread, titled “Amazing discovery for our next volume!” was from Quinn, who’d had the [great idea]({{ site.baseurl }}/dsc1/) to start the Data-Sitters Club in the first place. The DSC is a group of scholars that are creating a DH guide to computational text analysis by building and analyzing a corpus of the Baby-Sitters Club books, and I was the last member to join before we launched a few months ago (there’s more about all the members of the gang and our history in [Chapter 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/chapter-2/)). Quinn asked me to be part of the DSC because of my background in [children’s literature and childhood studies](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/re-enchanted), and because of my DH-friendliness as the director of the [Center for Experimental Humanities](https://eh.bard.edu) at Bard College. But not particularly for my data mining experience, because it’s not something I usually do! Everyone in the DSC was so nice, and I already knew some of the other members from before, but already I was feeling out of place.
