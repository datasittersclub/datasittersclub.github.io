# About The Data-Sitters Club

As we have observed, _The Baby-Sitters Club_ books tend to include a formulaic "Chapter 2," where main characters are introduced with stock characterization. Say hello to your friends...

First, we should tell you about The Data-Sitters Club, how it works, and who we are. It all started one day when Quinn Dombrowski was on vacation in Las Vegas, and started getting nostalgic about Ann M. Martin’s iconic series about girlhood in the upper-middle-class American suburbs of the 1990’s. There’s been very little scholarship written on the series, and Quinn started wondering what she might find by applying digital humanities computational text analysis tools and methods to that corpus. And it’d be even better to share those findings alongside a detailed description of how she went about the process of doing the text analysis, spelling out all the steps and decisions along the way! Quinn found some friends on DH Twitter who wanted to join her, and together, we started The Data-Sitters Club.
