   It’s hard to believe we’ve been doing the DSC for 5 years now. This book tackles the topic of environments – specifically, the environment on your computer where you run your code. It’s been about a whole year since I started writing this. And I’m coming at it now from a better place: work switched out my laptop, so I actually had to follow my own early notes here to rebuild my environment and be able to get back to publishing DSC books.

   My coding environment isn’t the only one that I’m rebuilding right now. I’ve filed for divorce. Bless Ann M. Martin for her work explaining divorce to kids: I literally brought out the graphic novel of <em>Karen’s Witch</em> when I broke the news to my kids. (They weren’t shocked, but they were super excited about Karen’s description of DOUBLE HOLIDAYS.) 

   Throughout this whole process, the Data-Sitters have been there for me, checking in and offering support and advice. So before we dive into Conda and Pip and all that coding environment goodness, let me start by saying that going home after a fun day out with friends shouldn’t fill you with dread. You shouldn’t feel like you have to constantly apologize for things to be okay. You shouldn’t be asking for permission all the time. You shouldn’t be afraid to say, “No, that’s not what I want” , and should know you’ll be heard. And there’s no shame in needing to be loved in the way(s) that are meaningful for you, even if you’re still figuring out what exactly that looks like. 
   
   If your own environment is dragging you down (even if you can talk yourself into it being fine), or if it isn’t what you need to feel like a happy and fulfilled person, you can change it. You really can. Even if you have kids and a mortgage. Or if it means taking a huge leap of faith with a job, or trying a new city. If you’re reading this, you’re still alive and today can be the day that you make radically different choices about what to do with your life. You’re truly not as stuck as you might think, and you might be shocked at how much better you feel on the other side of it.
